# Week 6 Classification I

## Summary

This week's lecture began with a review of various studies applying remote sensing, all of which extract land cover from Earth observation data in some form, thereby introducing the concept of Classification and how to classify remote sensing data. In the latter part of the lecture, various Machine Learning methods were specifically introduced (see mind map) for use in various data classifications, including image classification.

The practical session focused on explaining how to implement classification in GEE and also discussed how to divide data into training and testing sets to evaluate the classifier. The image below is this week's mind map, to facilitate revision.

## Applications

As illustrated in the Summary section, the classification of remote sensing data can be applied to understand, manage, and monitor land changes. @W6R1 utilised high-resolution satellite images to map and analyse land use/land cover features in Tel Aviv and Basel.

A more detailed example of observation is that @W6R2 use of hyperspectral data to classify roofing materials, incorporating machine learning methods. They employed discriminant analysis feature extraction (DAFE) to extract features and then categorised the data using the ISODATA algorithm. After reducing the data dimensions, they used the ECHO classifier for the final classification. Their research also lays the groundwork and contributes to studies on rooftop greening or rooftop solar power, two strategies that can alleviate urban climate and energy challenges.

## Reflection

This week, we learned about various Machine Learning methods, which integrate well with CASA0006 Data Science for Spatial Systems (as I mentioned in my first-week Reflection). This week's experience was somewhat similar to the third week on Corrections, where encountering numerous mathematical formulas in literature readings was inevitable. However, most of it concerned the direct application of machine learning methods for data classification, with not much derivation of formulas involved. I had encountered a bit of Machine Learning knowledge before, but combining remote sensing data with Machine Learning was a first-time attempt for me.

In the literature readings, I was surprised to see some studies from over a decade ago using machine learning for more local and detailed image classification, such as the rooftop material classification mentioned above, and their research results were particularly impressive. With machine learning being widely publicized by mainstream media in recent years, I believe the combination of machine learning with remote sensing technology will become more popular, have stronger development, and progress faster in the future.

# Week 7 Classification II

## Summary

This week's lecture advanced our understanding of Classification, delving into two specialized remote sensing image analysis techniques: Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and Sub Pixel Analysis. OBIA aggregates neighbouring pixels that share similar characteristics into objects for more cohesive analysis, whereas Sub Pixel Analysis intricately resolves mixed pixels situations, where a single pixel encompasses multiple land surface types.

Evaluating the accuracy of outcomes is paramount. The Confusion Matrix is instrumental in assessing classification models' performance, facilitating the calculation of key metrics such as Producer's Accuracy, User's Accuracy, and Overall Accuracy. Moreover, it enables the derivation of the Kappa Coefficient, offering a comparative measure of the image's accuracy against chance coincidences. The culmination of the lecture underscored the importance of validation, spotlighting strategies like training and testing data splits and cross-validation techniques. The lecture integrated the concept of spatial autocorrelation, as previously introduced in CASA0005, heralding the adoption of Spatial Cross Validation. This approach considers the influence of spatial factors and strives to reduce spatial autocorrelation between the training and testing datasets, thereby enhancing the reliability of model assessments.

## Applications

Last week we explored classification, and this week's literature focuses on the assessment of accuracy and the precision comparison of various methods. @W7R1 employed non-parametric rules for supervised classification to categorise and map land use/land cover in the study area. They conducted an accuracy assessment, and their kappa coefficient was 0.722, which is rated as substantial, affirming that this classified image is suitable for further research. Their study is an excellent example of conducting an accuracy assessment.

@W7R2 investigated the accuracy of different Land Use / Land Cover (LULC) mapping algorithms, thereby identifying the best classifiers for Earth Observation (EO) further. They studied six machine learning algorithms, including the well-known Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Their results indicated that the RF algorithm is the best LULC classifier among these six algorithms.

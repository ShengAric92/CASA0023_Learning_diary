    "text": "About me\nHi! I’m Sheng! I am an online music producer and currently a student in the 2023-2024 MSc Urban Spatial Science programme at UCL. I graduated from the University of Glasgow in 2022 with an MA in Mathematics and Music. During my undergraduate studies, I focused on music composition and analysis. In addition to enjoying pleasant film scores, I also like researching cool but somewhat incomprehensible music, such as stochastic processes, music matrices, and even the application of group theory in music composition.\nIn the following year, I went on to pursue an MSc in Computational Applied Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh. During this period, my coding and data analysis skills were further enhanced. To me, mathematics represents a beautiful yet challenging combination, something to be loved and endured with difficulty. The journey of studying mathematics has been replete with bumps and tumbles, yet it has been thoroughly fascinating. After graduating from Edinburgh, I then moved to London.\nI have lived in different cities, studied various subjects, and experienced diverse lifestyles. When I’m tired, I tend to slack off, and when I’m bored, I become very diligent. Indeed, I am someone who places more emphasis on experiences and feelings...\n\n\n\nOne day, as I was flipping through my music scores, I noticed that the fluctuating notes resembled the uneven skyscrapers. Hey, don’t you think the structure and development of music are similar to that of cities? I think it’s time for me to get even closer to these beautiful cities...\nMy musician account name is AricGT, and you can find me on the NetEase Cloud Music platform. I must apologize for not updating it in over three years (because mathematics has been quite challenging, haha, and it has taken up a lot of my time)!\nThank you very much for viewing my learning diary or for listening to my tracks.\n\n\n\nThe observant among you might notice that the covers of my two singles were shot in two different cities, Glasgow and London. In fact, I visited London once before in 2018. That last visit was part of a college activity, which was to watch a musical. This time, returning to London, I began my journey studying Urban Spatial Science."

    "text": "1.1 Summary\nThe first week’s lecture provided a general introduction to the fundamentals of remote sensing. In a nutshell, remote sensing refers to the use of sensors mounted on remote platforms to acquire and record information from a distance.\n\nThis week’s lecture provided insights into two different types of sensors: active and passive sensors. The former actively emits electromagnetic waves, consumes more energy, and has penetrating capabilities, allowing it to operate around the clock. The latter, on the other hand, utilizes energy without emitting anything and is relatively less costly compared to active sensors; however, it is sensitive to climatic conditions.\n\n\n\n\nDiagram of a passive sensor versus an active sensor (Source: EARTHDATA)\n\n\n\nAdditionally, I gained an understanding of the principles of electromagnetic wave and radiation propagation, along with related physical phenomena, such as atmospheric scattering.\nTypically, remote sensing data is in raster format. However, the data format also depends on the type of sensor, such as LiDAR point cloud data.\nThere are four common types of remote sensing resolutions: Spatial, Spectral, Radiometric, and Temporal. Different resolutions have their specific application scenarios.\n\nThe image below is a mind map that I created using Xmind. It summarises this week’s content in the form of keywords, facilitating my ability to associate and review the material.\n\n\n\nMind map for Week 1 content\n\n\nThis week’s practical taught me how to download and process Sentinel and Landsat data. Using SNAP for data preprocessing and R for data analysis allowed me to explore Landsat and Sentinel data and understand spectral signatures. For this practical, I chose the city of Port Elizabeth in South Africa, a port city with diverse geographical features. The most interesting part for me was selecting different band combinations to create colour composites. I chose Natural Colour (B4, B3, B2), Colour Infrared (B8, B4, B3), Atmospheric Penetration Composite (B12, B11, B8A), and Agriculture Band Combinations (B11, B8, B2) (see below). Through Colour Infrared and Agriculture Band Combinations, we can more intuitively assess the health of vegetation and crops. In Colour Infrared, healthy vegetation typically appears bright red, while in Agriculture Band Combinations, it appears bright green. I discovered that the vegetation along the southern coast of Port Elizabeth is very healthy, whereas the vegetation in the northeast is relatively less so.\n\n\n\nColour composites of Port Elizabeth"

    "text": "1.3 Reflection\nI wasn’t very familiar with this field before. However, through this week’s study, I’ve grasped the basics of remote sensing and realized its significance. Remote sensing allows people to see the Earth’s surface clearly, and different sensors and data formats have specific applications.\nCompared to the overall difficulty of CASA0005, getting started with the first practical of this course was somewhat challenging. Therefore, I want to emphasize that processing remote sensing data is much harder than expected! It requires a significant amount of time, continuous practice, and adaptation. However, it’s also very interesting. I’m genuinely happy when I’m using SNAP, curiously and tirelessly observing the images.\n(Here’s a personal experience using R and SNAP: Compared to SNAP, R can process data more quickly and efficiently as the code is more adaptable, and it integrates well with other libraries, facilitating data analysis and visualization (such as chart making). However constantly working with code can become tedious, and R does not readily provide a dynamic observation and monitoring experience (unless one writes a series of interactive design codes). On the other hand, SNAP boasts many powerful features for an enhanced visual experience, such as drag and zoom, Colour Manipulation, and even World View (where you can drag the Earth!), though its complex layout may need to be more beginner-friendly.\nSNAP excels in data preprocessing and provides a solid visual presentation. R, conversely, is better suited for more detailed analysis and visualization of data (like data distribution, trend changes, and comparative analysis).)\nI’ve become more curious about the details of remote sensing technology, such as how various indices are calculated. Moreover, while reading the literature, I’ve noticed that in recent years, most remote sensing data has almost always been linked to the term ‘Machine Learning.’ I will keep an eye on the Machine Learning field, and by combining it with the course CASA0006 this term, I should gain more insights.\n\n\n\n\nGibson, Rebecca, Tim Danaher, Warwick Hehir, and Luke Collins. 2020. “A Remote Sensing Approach to Mapping Fire Severity in South-Eastern Australia Using Sentinel 2 and Random Forest.” Remote Sensing of Environment 240: 111702. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0034425720300717.\n\n\nKaplan, Gordana, Ugur Avdan, and Zehra Yigit Avdan. 2018. “Urban Heat Island Analysis Using the Landsat 8 Satellite Data: A Case Study in Skopje, Macedonia.” In Proceedings, 2:358. 7.

    "text": "1.2 Applications\nNavalgund, Jayaraman, and Roy (2007) point out that remote sensing data application fields are vast, encompassing forestry, agriculture, marine resources, disaster prediction, and more. This technology, primarily focused on identifying features on the Earth’s surface, is particularly well-suited for environmental protection and climate forecasting (natural resources).\nA typical application scenario is the prediction and prevention of forest fires. Gibson et al. (2020) used Sentinel-2 imagery and random forest machine learning methods to accurately map the severity of fires in southeastern Australia. Sentinel-2 has a high update frequency (short revisit time) and 13 spectral bands (two more than Landsat 8-9). More spectral bands and shorter revisit times make Sentinel-2 more suitable for preventing forest fires than Landsat 8-9.\nHowever, Landsat 8-9 has a Thermal Infrared Sensor, which can effectively capture the land surface temperature, making Landsat 8-9 more suitable for addressing urban heat island effects. Kaplan, Avdan, and Avdan (2018) used Landsat 8 Satellite Data to analyze the urban heat island in Skopje, Macedonia.\nThese pieces of literature highlight the importance of remote sensing technology and tell me that different sensors have advantages and disadvantages. We must rationally use them and apply them in the most suitable fields."

    "text": "3.1 Summary\nThis week’s lecture primarily taught us several types of “corrections”: Geometric Correction, Atmospheric Correction, Orthorectification Correction, and Radiometric Calibration. Due to atmospheric factors, varying terrains, and weaknesses of different sensors, remote sensing images may have imperfections, making Correction essential. Different types of correction methods are utilised to address image distortions, inaccuracies, and impacts caused by various factors, to obtain images that more closely represent the actual conditions of the Earth’s surface.\n\nGeometric Correction can rectify distortions in images caused by the sensor’s angle of view, the Earth’s rotation, and other factors. It necessitates the identification of ground control points (GPS) to match known points in the image with those in the reference dataset and then constructs a model to align the pixels.\nThis week’s practical session focuses primarily on Atmospheric Correction. Atmospheric scattering reduces image contrast and produces “adjacent effects.” Biophysical parameters and spectral signatures through time and space are essential for Atmospheric Correction. The practical explained the principles and formulas of Dark Object Subtraction (the darkest pixel should be 0).\nOrthorectification falls under the category of georectification, aimed at eliminating distortions to ensure pixels are viewed as if from nadir.\nRadiometric calibration converts Digital Numbers to spectral radiance, allowing images to reflect spectral characteristics.\n\n\n\n\nTrue color composite vs Atmospheric correction (Source: NASA)\n\n\nIn addition, I also learned about image stitching techniques and the principles behind various types of image enhancement. This week’s practical involved hands-on application of many enhancement methods. I found the ratio most interesting, as it allows us to highlight specific landscape features in an image. The image below demonstrates my use of the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to observe the area I selected in the first week, covering Port Elizabeth, thereby highlighting regions with healthy vegetation. A higher NDVI value indicates more excellent vegetation cover and better growth conditions.\n\n\n\nSelected Area NDVI\n\n\nThe image below is a mind map I created based on the knowledge acquired this week, to facilitate revision.\n\n\n\nMind map for Week 3 content"

Despite its booming economy, it faces severe climate challenges. City of Los Angeles (2021) outlets have expressed concern about the climate in Los Angeles, noting that over the next few decades, the average temperature in Los Angeles is expected to rise by 5 degrees Fahrenheit, with extreme heat causing significant damage.

The Cool Streets program incorporates many strategies, including shade structures and cool pavements. In October 2020, the City Council approved a policy requiring all new roofs to be cool roofs. The city’s Sustainable City Plan has set a goal to reduce the temperature difference between the city and rural areas by 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit by 2025.\n\n\n\nLos Angeles surrounding areas (Source: Medium)\n\n\nCenter for Resilient Cities and Landscapes (2020) has proposed a Heat Vulnerability Assessment.

Shin, Pollard, and Muller (1997) have provided a more precise geometric correction algorithm to match coastlines. Gilmore, Saleem, and Dewan (2015) evaluated images corrected by Dark Object Subtraction (DOS), and the results showed that this method significantly improves the differentiation of wetland areas.\n\n\n\nNDWI produced by raw, optimal threshold, DOS and DOS optimal threshold (Gilmore, Saleem, & Dewan, 2015)\n\n\nOf course, there is literature continuously optimizing this method. For instance, Chavez Jr (1988) pointed out the weakness of DOS, namely, that the haze values for each spectral band are selected independently and are influenced by atmospheric scattering. Therefore, the author improved the method by normalizing the predicted haze values.\nThrough reading the literature, I’ve found that researchers are increasingly favoring the continuous optimization of correction methods’ accuracy (after all, everyone hopes to obtain more accurate images). However, increasing accuracy might also increase computational demand (the optimization methods mentioned above all have greater model computational complexity). There is always a trade-off between accuracy and computational effort, so some simpler methods (like DOS) remain very popular."

Many examples of using remote sensing technology to tackle the UHI effect exist. These efforts mainly aim to observe and detect urban heat vulnerability and then utilize vulnerability maps in combination with policies to construct and improve specific urban areas. For example, Ko et al. (2022) deployed cooling pavement devices across a large spatial scale.\nRemote sensing data have also been used to examine further the effects of different mitigation solutions, such as Maruya (2021) studied the impact of albedo and cool pavement coatings on street surface temperatures using remote sensing infrared temperature data.\nMoreover, some studies use remote sensing data to investigate the underlying factors contributing to the UHI effect and how these data can more effectively represent urban observations. Vahmani and Hogue (2014) combined Landsat and MODIS data to generate parameters such as Green Vegetation Fraction (GVF), albedo, and Impervious Surface Area (ISA). It was found that GVF enhanced the capability to observe urban vegetation areas.
